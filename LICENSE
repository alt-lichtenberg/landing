# Licensing

This project uses a **dual-license** model. The source code and the content
are covered by different licenses. Please read both sections carefully.

---

## Code — AGPL-3.0-or-later

All source code in this repository (Astro components, layouts, stylesheets,
configuration files, build scripts, and any other code) is licensed under the
**GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later)**.

See [LICENSE-AGPL-3.0](LICENSE-AGPL-3.0) for the full license text.

This means you are free to use, modify, and redistribute the code — as long as
you publish your modifications under the same license. Because this is the
*Affero* GPL, the copyleft obligation also applies when you run a modified
version on a server and let others interact with it over a network.

### What counts as "Code"

- `src/` — Astro components, layouts, page structure (`.astro`, `.ts`, `.js`)
- `src/styles/` — CSS / Tailwind theme configuration
- `astro.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- Any other configuration, build, or automation files
